Many icons are sourced from [Bearded Icons](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-icons) for VS Code. Most of these icons are distributed under the original [LICENSE](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-icons/blob/master/LICENSE).

Some missing icons have been created by me and are distributed under the same license.
