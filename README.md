Beautiful looking Icons for [Zed](https://zed.dev)

# License
Many Icons are source from the [Bearded Icons](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-icons) For VSCode. Most of the icons are distributed under the origin [LICENSE](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-icons/blob/master/LICENSE)

Some of the missing icons are created by me and distributed under the same license.
